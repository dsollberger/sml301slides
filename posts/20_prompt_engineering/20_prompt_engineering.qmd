# Interpretability

::: {.callout-note}
## Interpretability

Ideally, we would want our machine learning models to have **interpretability** where we could describe the effect of each coefficient in the model.  However, as technologies advanced, we sacrificed interpretability for deep learning.

> In 2002, Paul Graham used Bayes' Rule as part of his algorithms to greatly decrease false positive rates of unwanted e-mails ("spam").   Let $H^{c}$ be the event that an e-mail is "spam".  Let $W$ be the event that an e-mail contains a trigger word such as "watches".  Suppose that

- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is spam is 17\%
- the probability that an e-mail contains that word given that it is not spam is 9\%
- the probability that a randomly selected e-mail message is spam is 80\%

> Find the probability that an e-mail message is spam, given that the trigger word appears.

# LLM Hyperparameters

::: {.callout-tip}
## Hyperparameters

In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter that can be set in order to define any configurable part of a model's learning process. Hyperparameters can be classified as either model hyperparameters (such as the topology and size of a neural network) or algorithm hyperparameters (such as the learning rate and the batch size of an optimizer). These are named hyperparameters in contrast to parameters, which are characteristics that the model learns from the data.

## Temperature

::: {.callout-note}
## Temperature

For this hyperparameter, **temperature** rescales logits before applying a softmax

$$p_{i} = \frac{e^{z_{i}/T}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{z_{i}/T}}$$

* $T = 0$: greedy selection of softmax
* low temperature (e.g. $T = 0.301$): more deterministic output
* high temperature (e.g. $T = 1.301$): more creative output

## Hallucinations

"Hallucination happens when an AI model makes stuff up. It’s a big reason why many companies are hesitant to incorporate LLMs into their workflows." --- [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html)

## Top-p

::: {.callout-note}
## Top-p

For this hyperparameter, **top-p** (aka **nucleus sampling**) restricts the possible outputs to those whose *cumulative softmax* is at most $P_{\text{top}}$

$$i \text{ where } \sum_{j = 1}^{i} \frac{e^{z_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{z_{i}}} \leq P_{\text{top}}$$

* low top-p (e.g. `top_p` = 0.301): more deterministic output
* high top-p (e.g. `top_p` = 0.903): more creative output

## Application

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## hyperparameter tuning intuition

* high temperature, high `top-p`: brainstorming
* low temperature, low `top-p`: email generation
* high temperature, low `top-p`: creative writing
* low temperature, high `top-p`: translation
