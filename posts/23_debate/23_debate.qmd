# Scene

I am in a teaching group called `Teaching Controversial Topics`, and with them I want to draft a case study from the realm of artificial intelligence. For this teaching group, I am hoping to produce

* 20-minute classroom activity for the SML 301 students
* a blog post for me

Dr Sarah-Jane Leslie suggested that I look into either "privacy/copyright issues around training data for LLMs" or "the role of government regulation in AI development".  Especially drawn to the latter, idea I have then been picturing a classroom debate about government regulation in AI.  I think that this would appeal to my audience of mostly engineering majors. Over the summer in the AI4ALL summer camp, Dr Steven Kelts led a great ethics debate with the students, and I am hoping to emulate that by partitioning the SML 301 students into 4 roles such as

1. congressional staffers
2. business lobbyists
3. data privacy NGO
4. legal advisors

## Disclosure on AI Use

Despite thinking about this project for the past 4 months (inspired by the BIOME25 conference), I admit that I am assembling these materials merely a couple of weeks before my proposed launch date.  I hardly have experience in debate, much less in setting up one.  Thus, one can imagine that I too would want AI assistance to complete this task.

My students and I have recently covered materials about AI---particularly prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation---so I am indeed inclined to try to justify AI usage here as careful examination of LLM results.

# Prompt Engineering

My students, perhaps as a reflection of the learning environment that I create, are a quiet group of people.  In fact, I set up an anonymous Slido poll each week to receive questions rather than having the students raise their hands.  With that in mind, asking them to vocalize a debate will be quite a shift in expectations.  

To mitigate that aberrant request, I want to give each student a one-page **character sheet** to on-board them into the roles (stated above). I hope that each character sheet provides several possible talking points to encourage and guide the debate.

Even after I read some materials (below in the "RAG" section), I find that I myself am not a writer of debates.  Thus, I shall employ **prompt engineering** to create the bullet-point lists of talking points.  The idea of debate roles lends itself well for the prompt engineering tool.

Following materials found in Chapter 6 of [Hands-On Large Language Models](https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models) (by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst), we can construct an LLM prompt with parts like ...

Continuing with the materials found in Chapter 6 of [Hands-On Large Language Models](https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models), I used the [Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) LLM (made by Microsoft) and its tokenizer to process these prompts.

### character sheet

1. **Regulatory Framework**: The U.S. government's approach to AI regulation has been a mix of federal and state-level initiatives. The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office (NAIIO) and the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) are federal efforts aimed at advancing AI research and development. However, the Trump administration's Executive Order #14179 and the proposed "TAKE IT DOWN Act" reflect a deregulatory stance, emphasizing innovation over risk mitigation. This contrasts with the Biden administration's Executive Order, which seeks to establish a comprehensive AI regulatory framework. The debate should consider the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public safety and ethical standards.

2. **AI in Healthcare**: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a role in regulating AI applications in healthcare, such as the approval process for AI-driven medical devices. The FDA's involvement ensures that AI applications in healthcare meet safety and efficacy standards, protecting patients from potential harm. This regulatory oversight is crucial in maintaining public trust in AI technologies, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare.

3. **AI and Privacy**: The Biden administration's AI Bill of Rights emphasizes the importance of privacy and data security in AI applications. This includes the requirement for AI systems to be transparent about their use of personal data and the implementation of watermarking to inform users about AI-generated content. These measures are essential in protecting individuals' privacy rights and ensuring that AI technologies are used ethically and responsibly.

4. **State and Local Government Interventions**: The New York City Bias Audit Law and California's Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act represent state and local efforts to address AI-related risks and biases. These initiatives highlight the importance of local governance in complementing federal efforts to regulate AI. The debate should consider the effectiveness of these local measures in mitigating AI risks and promoting ethical AI development
