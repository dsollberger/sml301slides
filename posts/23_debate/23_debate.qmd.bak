# Scene

I am in a teaching group called `Teaching Controversial Topics`, and with them I want to draft a case study from the realm of artificial intelligence. For this teaching group, I am hoping to produce

* 20-minute classroom activity for the SML 301 students
* a blog post for me

Dr Sarah-Jane Leslie suggested that I look into either "privacy/copyright issues around training data for LLMs" or "the role of government regulation in AI development".  Especially drawn to the latter, idea I have then been picturing a classroom debate about government regulation in AI.  I think that this would appeal to my audience of mostly engineering majors. Over the summer in the AI4ALL summer camp, Dr Steven Kelts led a great ethics debate with the students, and I am hoping to emulate that by partitioning the SML 301 students into 4 roles such as

1. congressional staffers
2. business lobbyists
3. data privacy NGO
4. legal advisors

## Disclosure on AI Use

Despite thinking about this project for the past 4 months (inspired by the BIOME25 conference), I admit that I am assembling these materials merely a couple of weeks before my proposed launch date.  I hardly have experience in debate, much less in setting up one.  Thus, one can imagine that I too would want AI assistance to complete this task.

My students and I have recently covered materials about AI---particularly prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation---so I am indeed inclined to try to justify AI usage here as careful examination of LLM results.

# Prompt Engineering

My students, perhaps as a reflection of the learning environment that I create, are a quiet group of people.  In fact, I set up an anonymous Slido poll each week to receive questions rather than having the students raise their hands.  With that in mind, asking them to vocalize a debate will be quite a shift in expectations.  

To mitigate that aberrant request, I want to give each student a one-page **character sheet** to on-board them into the roles (stated above). I hope that each character sheet provides several possible talking points to encourage and guide the debate.

Even after I read some materials (below in the "RAG" section), I find that I myself am not a writer of debates.  Thus, I shall employ **prompt engineering** to create the bullet-point lists of talking points.  The idea of debate roles lends itself well for the prompt engineering tool.

Following materials found in Chapter 6 of [Hands-On Large Language Models](https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models) (by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst), we can construct an LLM prompt with parts like ...

### character sheet

#### 1. Precautionary Principle
Implementing regulations based on the precautionary principle might be a starting point. This principle suggests that in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof falls on those advocating for an action that may harm the public or the environment. In the context of AI, this could mean strict regulations on the deployment of generative AI until its risks are fully understood.

#### 2. Risk-Based Regulation
Adopting a risk-based regulatory approach would involve identifying and assessing the risks associated with generative AI and applying regulations proportionally. This could include specific licensing requirements for developers, mandatory impact assessments, and the establishment of AI ethics committees.

#### 3. Self-Regulation and Industry Standards
Encouraging or mandating self-regulation within the AI industry could be another option. This would involve the development of industry standards and best practices for the responsible use of generative AI. While self-regulation can be effective, it often requires a strong culture of ethics and accountability within the industry.

#### 4. International Cooperation
Given the global nature of AI development and its potential impacts, international cooperation and harmonization of regulations could be crucial. This might involve global standards for transparency, accountability, and ethical use of generative AI, facilitated by international organizations or agreements.

#### 5. Adaptive Regulation
Adopting an adaptive regulatory approach that evolves with the technology could allow for more flexibility and responsiveness to new developments in generative AI. This could involve regular reviews of regulations and the establishment of mechanisms for rapid response to emerging risks.

#### 6. Public Engagement and Transparency
Engaging the public in discussions about the development and regulation of generative AI can help ensure that the technology aligns with societal values and expectations. Transparency about the capabilities and risks of generative AI, as well as the regulatory processes, can build public trust and facilitate informed decision-making.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Rapid Technological Advancement**: The pace of AI development, particularly in generative AI, poses a significant challenge to regulators. Regulations may quickly become outdated if they are not adaptable.
- **Global Impact**: Generative AI has the potential to impact societies worldwide, making international cooperation essential. However, differences in regulatory philosophies and priorities can complicate this process.
- **Balancing Innovation and Protection**: Regulators must balance the need to protect individuals and society from potential harms with the desire to foster innovation and economic growth.
- **Ethical and Societal Implications**: Generative AI raises complex ethical and societal questions, including issues related to privacy, consent
