# Setup

## Windows

For those of us who use Windows, we might want to ensure that the `Python` program is accessible to command-line and other interfaces.  During installation, ensure that "Add Python to environment variables" is set.

## Python Environments

Actually, the above is naive advice on my part.  Python programmers know that keeping separate *environments* is wiser since Python programming is rife with the possibility of having incompatible packages.  As we will soon see, advice for small programs is to use **virtual environments**
:::


## Virtual Environments

Especially when trying out new software, Python programmers recommend using **virtual environments** that are quarantined from the rest of a computer so that installing packages there do not disturb other projects.

* open a command-line interface (CLI)
* navigate to the folder where you want to build a virtual environment
* install a virtual environment with

```
python -m venv vir_env
```

(where `vir_env` is a label that you can customize)

* activate and enter the virtual environment with

### Mac

```
source vir_env/bin/activate

# Marimo

## Installation

We can now install `marimo` (say, within a virtual environment) with

```
pip install marimo
```

## Tutorials

We can peruse the features of `marimo` through their tutorials

* `marimo tutorial intro`
* `marimo tutorial dataflow`
* `marimo tutorial ui`
* `marimo tutorial markdown`
* `marimo tutorial plots`
* `marimo tutorial sql`
* `marimo tutorial layout`
* `marimo tutorial fileformat`
* `marimo tutorial markdown-format`
* `marimo tutorial for-jupyter-users`

## Coup de Grace

One of the best applications of `marimo` (for our SML 301 course) is [this demonstration](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo?tab=readme-ov-file#learn-more) of an embedding of the MNIST data set:

# Data Ethics

## Governmental Regulation of AI

Students were handed *character sheets* (persona, objective, talking points) and their persona roles could be

* Congressional staffer
* Business Lobbyist
* Data Privacy NGO
* Paralegal
